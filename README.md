# Global Quality of Life Analysis

## Overview

This project provides an analysis of the quality of life across various countries using data-driven techniques. The dataset includes multiple factors such as Purchasing Power, Safety, Healthcare, Climate, Cost of Living, Pollution, and others. The goal is to explore and visualize the differences among countries and identify key factors influencing quality of life.

This analysis was conducted as part of my summer internship organized by the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC).

## Dataset

The dataset contains quality-of-life related scores and categories for 236 countries, with features like:

- Purchasing Power Value & Category
- Safety Value & Category
- Health Care Value & Category
- Climate Value & Category
- Cost of Living Value & Category
- Property Price to Income Value & Category
- Traffic Commute Time Value & Category
- Pollution Value & Category
- Overall Quality of Life Value & Category

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/** – Jupyter notebook(s) with the data analysis and visualizations.  
- **data/** – Contains datasets used for the analysis (if included).  
- **visuals/** – Images or plots generated during EDA (optional).  
- **README.md** – Project documentation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

As the foundational phase of this project, I performed the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, which included:

- Data loading and inspection.
- Cleaning and handling missing values.
- Statistical descriptions of features.
- Visualizing distributions of quality of life factors using charts and heatmaps.
- Investigating relationships and correlations among various quality of life indicators.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for development and presentation

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Global-Quality-Of-Life-Analysis.git
cd Global-Quality-Of-Life-Analysis


2. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Open the notebook in Jupyter:


4. Follow the notebook cells to explore the analysis.

## Insights

- The analysis highlights disparities in living conditions worldwide.
- Visualizations provide intuitive comparisons of various indices.
- Investigated influence of factors such as pollution, healthcare, and safety on overall quality of life.

## My Contribution

I was responsible for performing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which forms the core and critical first step of the data science workflow. This included data cleaning, generating statistical summaries, visualizing key indicators, and interpreting initial patterns to guide further analysis.
